### **Matters of Legality**
- **Which legal lisence did this project use?:** &nbsp; other
<br/>
- **Is anyone else offered credit due for this project?:** &nbsp; The coding and illustration work are of my own creation, but the music track "Disort into Me" was produced by the musician Lain Volta Trzaska for his musical project "She" (also known as "shemusic"). Given the limited and educational scope of this project, my use of the song would fall under Fair Use.

### **What does the future hold for this project?**
- Where this is a set story....the next step for the concept would be to require user end input to change the outcome of the story. Kind of like a "Choose your own Adventure" book.
